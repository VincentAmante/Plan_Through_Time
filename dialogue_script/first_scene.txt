Narration: 
Anyway, time to show you what Red has always suspected.

My necklace, a golden pocketwatch.

This watch has saved me, countless of times.
My line of work is dangerous,
but this nifty device lets me do what you already know will happen.

It takes me back in time, at will.

And will it I do, and now my necklace glows.
I watched the world slowly turn to white, every scene fading. 

and I stood there, vowing to do what my colleague has forced me to do.

Time to stop Red from dying.
