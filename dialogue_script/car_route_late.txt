first time {
    I sat in my car, unable to move it as the two cars have come to block me

    Blue: Do I need to try another way? Maybe there's something I can do next time

    Regardless, I heard the acceleration noises from a distance.

    Blue: I can't make it to Red from here

    I listen to the rest of the voice mail

    Finally, I will for the time to go back to the beginning,
    the pocketwatch glows, and I wait as the flow of time streams upwards
}

subsequent times {
    Accepting that I can't act in this situation,
    I stayed motionless in my car.

    Blue: Sorry Red, can't save you this time.

    I closed my eyes, and let the rest of the voicemail play out

    [ TRANSCRIPT PLAYS HERE ]

    I go back in time, heading back to the beginning
