Narration:

first time {
    I'm back in my car again, I have Red's voice mails. 
    I'm back at the intersection.
    I see the bright pink car, just in front of me, crossing over to kill its owner.

    I open my phone to look at the map, and figure out the fastest way to get to Red.

    There's two routes I can take:

    1) The Alley Route: If I leave the car now, I'll be able to run over to Red through the alleys.
        Sure, I'll leave my car unattended, but it's not as important as the idiot genius.

        There's only one alley that takes me there, but it'll get me there faster than the road.

    2) Chase the car now: I can go after the car, chase after it.
        Then I'll ram it to prevent it from hitting Red

        Sounds ideal

    This is where you came in, dear voice in my head.
    I need your guidance, what do I do?
}

Subsequent times {
    Back in the car again. I see the pink car in front of me again.

    Here are my options:

        1) The Alley Route: If I leave the car now, I'll be able to run over to Red through the alleys.
        Sure, I'll leave my car unattended, but it's not as important as the idiot genius.

        There's only one alley that takes me there, but it'll get me there faster than the road.

        2) Chase the car now: I can go after the car, chase after it.
            Then I'll forcibly move it to prevent it from hitting Red

        What do I do?
