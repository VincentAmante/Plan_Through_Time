first time {
    Entering the right alley, I stumble upon a dead end.

    As I approach a pocket of space, I encounter a giant screen displaying a countdown.

    As soon as I approach, it begins to speak

    Screen: WELCOME BLUE! YOU'RE JUST IN TIIIIME FOR THE PASSWOORDDD!!

    Screen: 5!
    Screen: 4!
    Screen: 3!
    Screen: 2!
    Screen: 1!

    Screen: AND BEHOLD

    And suddenly, the screen displays the words 'SECOND HALF: 1024'
}

second time {
    Entering the right alley, nothing much changes.

    The giant screen is still there,
    displaying the same characters as it did before.

    Nothing changed from last time.
}

continuation {
    I heard the distant sound of a car accelerating,
    I can tell it's too late to find a way to Red at this point

    I let the rest of the voicemail play out

    Finally, fearing that overstaying might ruin the loop,
    I let the golden pocketwatch activate.
