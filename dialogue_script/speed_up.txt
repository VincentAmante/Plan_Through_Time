first encounter {
    Narration: 
    I went to speed up, almost tailgating the pink car.

    However, two cars suddenly came speeding out of the T-junction.
    Both of them are pink cars.

    Blue: Wait.. but it's green light for u-

    One of them ran into me, and rammed my car into the sidewalk

    I try to push on anyways, and chase after the pink car again.

    But they started blocking the path ahead of me.

    Blue: Who the hell are these guys?

    I couldn't look into the pink car, their windows are just as shaded as the one I'm after.
    
    I realised these might also be self-driving cars.

    Blue: Red, just how rich are you?!

    Actually, these were probably hijacked from our department

    Blue: If Ms. Edgeworth found out what you've been up to,
    I don't think saving you now would keep you alive

    Regardless, I couldn't get away from these cars when I see the distant figures of people heading towards where Red was

    Blue: .. Too late huh?
}

second encounter {
    I went to speed up, trying to catch up to the car

    Knowing that two cars would come out of the T-junction,
    I try to find a way to dodge them while still being able to get to the main car

    It wasn't successful

    Blue (Angry): Not again!

    The cars managed to crash into me again..

    I can tell there's no getting away from them at this point

    Blue (Disappointed): Maybe I need to try another way
