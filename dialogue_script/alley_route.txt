first time {
    I got out of my car,
    probably to the confusion and frustration of the drivers behind me.

    The alley was blocked by a chain fence, but I quickly climbed over it.

    I kept running.

    I see in front of me, three separate paths: left, right and forward.

    The left and right path lead to a dead end.
}

second time {
    I once again exit my car to run through the alley.
    Climbed over the fence again.

    There's three paths: left, right, forward.
}

robot not met:
{
    The way forward should lead straight to Red,
    
    yet there's a large mechanical figure that seems to occupy the path

    Blue: Right now, I still think we should go forward, but what do you think?
}

robot met {
    There's a large robot forward, but it's the only way ahead.
}

First passcode encountered {
    Maybe the other side will have the other half of the passcode?
}
