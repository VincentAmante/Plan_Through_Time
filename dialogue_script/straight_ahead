first time {
    As I run towards the middle,
    I get a closer look at the mechanical figure ahead of me..
    
    Blue: .. t-that's a huge robot!

    Robot: HELLO BLUE! DO YOU HAVE THE PASSWORD?

    Blue: Red.. you never fail to amaze me
}

second time {
    I run towards the robot again.

    Robot: HELLO BLUE! DO YOU HAVE THE PASSWORD?
}

no_password {
    Blue: .. I don't have the password

    Robot: NO PASS, NO ENTRY!

    I needed to get past this robot, if I want to rush to Red

    Blue: Do I head towards one of the other paths, or try to run past it?

    Choice: alley_left | get_past_it | alley_right
}

password {
    Blue: It's 15A-83LL4

    Robot: YOU MAY PASS

    Blue: Thanks

    Having been given permission, I ran past the robot

    Choice: Rush to Red
