first time {
    I head over the left alley,
    I could possibly find a secret path here.

    If not, I can rewind anyways

    I hear the noise of a spray,
    and I head towards it.

    It's a pink robot, about my size.

    It looks at me, and walks away

    Blue: .. ?

    It was then that I saw a graffiti writing

    In a perfect sans-serif font, the robot wrote 'FIRST HALF: 15A'

    Blue: Probably best to keep this in mind
}

second time {
    I head towards here.

    Does't seem like anything's changed,
    the same 15A is still written,
    nothing's changed from last time

    Blue: maybe it's best to go somewhere else instead
}

continuation {
    I heard the distant sound of a car accelerating,
    I can tell it's too late to find a way to Red at this point

    I let the rest of the voicemail play out


    Finally, fearing that overstaying might ruin the loop,
    I let the golden pocketwatch activate.
