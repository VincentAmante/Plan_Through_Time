finally.. after running through the alleys,

I see Red.

Alive.

Blue: RED!

Red was already looking my way, 
and I saw in those eyes an expression of relief.

Red: Hey! You're probably just in time!

And that's when I realised, the pink car is still on its way to Red

It's there, taking a turn, ready to accelerate

Without your opinion, I ran after Red

I ran and I ran, I heard the sounds of the pink car switch to a speed capable of killing us both

but I jumped towards Red.

and I did it.. I saved him

The pink car ran past the spot where Red stood, and then went to a standstill.

I was on the ground, with Red right under me.

Blue: y-you okay?

Red: .. so you can time travel

Blue: ..

Red: You knew I was going to die,
so you got out of your car,
maybe you thought it was the fastest way,
or you realised you couldn't catch up to my car on yours.

So you left it in the middle of the road,
and you got past by my robot.
I made sure you couldn't get past it,
that the only way you could get through it

Blue: ..was with a password

Red: and you couldn't have known any of that
since I planned it an hour ago
and the password made just recently

You couln't have known any of it,
if you weren't a time traveller,
am I right?

Blue: ..

Red: Glad to know that you're just a dirty cheater
Red: and not someone infinitely better than me

Blue: Can't believe you did it just for that

Red: shut up, you know I can't stand being outdone
