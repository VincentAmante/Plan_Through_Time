Narration: On your suggestion, I decided to ignore the red light and head straight for the pink car.

Blue: Wonder if I can get Red to pay for it when this is done.

Narration: 
I try to catch up to the car but it suddenly sped up.

first time {
    I see a T-junction up ahead,
    I could try to catch up to the car or hold back, see what happens
    }

subsequent {
     The T-junction is coming up,
     I know two cars will try and block me at this point
     Do I speed up or stay back?
}


Choices: Speed Up | Stay Back
