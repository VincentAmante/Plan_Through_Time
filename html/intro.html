                    Hello, voice in my head.
                    I wasn't sure how to go over what we went through in this memory,
                    it was a seemingly special, yet normal day.
                    I was supposed to meet up with Red at a nearby cafe, unusual because of how much they hate my guts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was in my car, waiting for a stoplight at an intersection.
                    The weather was nice, nothing too bad or too good about it.
                    When the light hit green, I was to turn left, go straight for a bit, turn left again.
                    Yet the light was red, probably for a while, and so I decided to wait.
                    and that was when I got the first of many voice calls
                </p>

                <p>It was from Red</p>

                    It's because I've decided I had enough with you outperforming me my entire life!<br>
                    For a long time I had my suspicions about how you do it, but I could never know how to prove it!<br>
                    Every day, for YEARS it frustrated me, sometimes I thought I was going insane.

                    but now!
                    I have a plan, and you're going to find out what it is!
                    Good luck!

            <h2>Voicemail Ends</h2>

            <div class = "narration">
                    <p>
                        All of a sudden, about half a dozen voice mails flooded my phone.
                        I looked over at them, they're all titled "DONT_LISTEN_YET" and then in ordered numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's from Red
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our line of work, instructions are probably the difference between life and death.
                        I decided to heed the title.
                    </p>

            <div class = "narration">
                <p>
                    and then I saw in front of me, a bright pink car. 
                    I didn't pay attention the first time, but looking back, all the windows were shaded.
                    It crossed the intersection in front of me, going the direction I was heading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would remember this car for the rest of my life.
