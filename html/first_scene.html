                    I continued on, just drove my way, not knowing what was about to happen.
                    Right before I got to the meeting point, however, I heard the sound of a loud acceleration.
                    Then I see people running towards where I was supposed to meet Red.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I drove around the corner, I saw.

                <p>
                    N-no way.. Red?!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "narration">
                <p> 
                    I saw Red's body, lying motionless.
                    I saw the window of the bright pink car bearing damage.
                    I ran over to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was at this point that my phone received a voicemail,
                    and the content immediately began to play.

                    So.. if you got this message, it means I got ran over.

                    Wonder why? Maybe you didn't know how to do it this time? <br>
                    If that's so then good luck on your future attempts! <br>
                    Maybe do better, you know?

                    Or perhaps I was mistaken about you. <br>
                    In which case, this was the most embarassing mistake of my life

                    It was at this moment I realised what just transpired.
                </p>

                <p>I ran to the pink car, which hasn't moved after it just ran over Red.
                    I couldn't see the inside, so I forced the door open.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nobody's inside
                </p>

                <p>
                    The screen beside the driver wheel revealed this car was self-driving.
                    Now normally, self-driving cars at this age don't run over people,
                    but this was hacked, tampered with, modified.
                    I looked at the car and its contents once more. <br>
                    With the way this car was decorated, the way it was cluttered,
                    the car being a government-issued vehicle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It was tampered by none other than my technological genius from work, Red.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The very Red who just got ran over by their own car.
