                    Finally.. after running through the alleys, I see Red.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alive.

                    RED!

                    Red was already looking my way, 
                    and I saw in those eyes an expression of relief.

                    And that's when I realised, the pink car is still on its way to Red

                    It's there, taking a turn, ready to accelerate

                    Without your opinion, I ran after Red
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class = "narration">
                <p>
                    I ran and I ran, I heard the sounds of the pink car switch to a speed capable of killing us both

                    but I jumped towards Red.
